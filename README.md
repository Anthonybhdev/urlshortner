</div>



## Overview





- I have gained alot of experience working with npm, Express.js, ejs and APIs. This application takes a long url link and shrinks it into a small link that can be customized by the user.

- I have learned the importance of to setup a server through node.js with npm. And how to connect an external API and make the proper calls to retrieve the correct data through post / request calls. My biggest challenge with this project was having the API except the url and then display the new shortner url in the browser and having it redirect to the long url link.


### Built With



- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [ejs](https://ejs.co/)
- [express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)

## Features



The Url shortner takes in a long url in form and does a post request to the app.js (server in node.js) and takes it through the API that shortens the url link and by using ejs to have that new value displayed under the shorten url text on the webpage.
